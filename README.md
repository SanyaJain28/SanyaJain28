## Hey There 👏,
Welcome to my repository.

- Obviously it is under construction but before you see my repository, you must get to know me.

- I am Sanya Jain and I am pursuing the Data science track from University Of Texas At Dallas.

# What got me into data science?

- ⏳ I started my career in business but being from a non-tech background everything from coding to data fascinated me much.
- 👸 Just like children have the fasciantion to do something new in life, I too developed the same fascination for Data Science and Tech.
- 🕤 I do practice leet code almost weekly and I love it!!
- 😎 I am still a work in progress but we all our work in progress until we die
- 💇 Also, I strongly believe and encourage the idea of women in Tech. Power to you---- girls 💃
- 🌴 I did never let my business degree go in vain as it has always been behind my intuition in Data science.
# What keeps me happy?
- I love to Travel 🚙
- I love to party 🌟
- I love to sleep 💣
- I do Binge watch netflix 🎬
- and I am mostly lazy but i call it an art 🌈
- And I do obviously manage all this with my new found love in Machine Learning!!
